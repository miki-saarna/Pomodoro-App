## Description

The Pomodoro Timer is used as a time management technique for maximizing efficiency in work or study. This technique makes use of splitting up periods of high productivity in intervals, with a short break in between each interval.

The timer in this application has the capability to adjust the duration of each period, and it can also be paused or stopped during a session. A countdown timer with a progress bar shows the time left during each period. Duration setter buttons are disabled during a session, whereas, the stop button is disabled while the timer is inactive.
